1. Introduction
-------------

This library arose with purpose to simulate graphs in Java. Basic tasks already were implemented like to model a graph using a class and to generate classical graphs by calling a factory class. I have used this library to teach Graph Theory course in Federal University of Goiás (UFG), Jataí Campus. 

2. Download
-------------

You can download this library in https://github.com/FreeUFG/GraphLib/.
